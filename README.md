# AWS EC2 Deployment Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates how I deploy and configure a virtual server using **Amazon EC2**.  
The goal is to launch a secure instance, connect to it, and prepare it for basic workloads.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Shows
- Launching an EC2 instance from the AWS Management Console  
- Selecting an AMI and instance type  
- Configuring security groups (firewall rules)  
- Connecting via SSH or RDP  
- Basic server configuration and testing  

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites
- AWS Free Tier account  
- Basic understanding of AWS console layout  
- SSH client (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows), depending on instance type  

---

## 🪜 Steps Performed
1. Created a new EC2 instance (AMI, instance type, key pair).  
2. Configured a security group with restricted inbound rules.  
3. Launched the instance and waited for it to enter the `running` state.  
4. Connected to the instance using SSH/RDP.  
5. Verified connectivity (ping, curl, basic commands).
