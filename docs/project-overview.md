# Project Overview — AWS EC2 Deployment

This project demonstrates how to launch, configure, and connect to a virtual server using Amazon EC2.  
It highlights foundational cloud engineering concepts such as provisioning compute resources, configuring network access, and performing Linux-based verification commands.

## Key Objectives
- Launch an EC2 instance using Free Tier resources
- Configure secure SSH access
- Understand how security groups act as virtual firewalls
- Successfully connect to the instance
- Verify operational status through basic commands

## Why This Matters
EC2 is one of the core services in AWS.  
Cloud Support and Cloud Engineering roles heavily rely on the ability to launch and troubleshoot EC2 instances.
